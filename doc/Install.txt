Please also watch the installation video's linked on the BBOS homepage where
you downloaded these files.

- Download and install MySQL (any version)
   http://dev.mysql.com/
   Using MySQL 5.5 will save you a step later
   Keep track of the directory you choose to install MySQL in during the install
   If possible, create a MySQL user for BBOS during the installation, see below
   In some installations you must check "Allow MySQL to be in your Windows PATH"
   You DO NOT need have the install add a firewall rule to run BBOS, it is up to you.
   If you would like to use your own user/password settings you must update the config file*.
   Alternatively you may run any other MySQL instance you like including WAMP servers

- Create a MySQL user named "bbos" with password "bbos"
  Give the user DBA privileges (Database Administrator) 
  Otherwise BBOS can't create your schema and tables to put the Gameday data in

- If you use a version of MySQL other then 5.5 or select a directory to
  install to other then the default you will have to change the location
  of MySQL in the BBOS config file referenced below.*  
  The current setting is:
  mySQLLocation = 'C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.5\\bin'
  in the file
  <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbos\config\bbosConfig.py
  
- Download and install Python 2.7 from http://www.python.org/
   BBOS will not work with 3.x versions of Python

- The following commands are run at a dos prompt from the directory you
  installed BBOS to
- Install the other Python modules BBOS uses by running:
  <install directory>\BBOS\src\installPythonLibs.py

- Open a DOS prompt window at Start->Programs->Accessories->Command Prompt
- Change directory to the location you have installed BBOS
- Install the database schemas to hold game information by running
  <install directory>\BBOS\src\createGamedaySchema.py
  <install directory>\BBOS\src\createRetrosheetSchema.py

- Read the help directions by running
   <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbos.py -h
   
- Load games into the database by running a load command on the bbos.py file**
   <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbos.py -r
   <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbos.py -y 2008
   or to load retrosheet data
   <install directory>\BBOS\src\retrosheet.py -y 2012
   
- Loading a year takes over an hour for either dataset, 
  if you choose these options be prepared to return later.

- By default bbos.py will load MLB data.  To load minor league data you
  must pass in the league you would like to load data for.
  <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbos.py aaa -r
  Minor leagues published by MLB which have data at the time of publication:
  'MLB','AAA','AAX','AFA','AFX','ASX','ROK','WIN'
   
- Congratulations, you now have a Gameday Pitch F/X and MLB player database.  

- If you wish the database to stay continually up to date feel free to schedule 
    "bbos.py -r" to run nightly via Windows or your favorite scheduling tool.

- If you wish to load player biographical information run a player bio load script 
   <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbosPlayerBio.py
   All options available to bbos.py are available to the bio script

- Go forth and prosper.  Ask questions of your database.

*Advanced options such as using you own MySQL configuration are found at
    <install directory>\BBOS\src\bbos\config\bbosConfig.py
    
**If a load fails mid way and you feel a game's data has not been completely
    loaded you can remove all the data for a particular game by running
      <install directory>\BBOS\src\deleteBBOSGame.py gid_2008_03_21_balmlb_slnmlb_1
    supplying the game name you would like removed
  If rerun, a load script will start at the first game it finds no data has yet 
  been loaded for.
